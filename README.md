## 1. Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) detection system that utilizes the MediaPipe holistic approach in combination with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Capable of accurately recognizing and interpreting ASL gestures in real time, enabling effective communication between the deaf and hearing communities.
